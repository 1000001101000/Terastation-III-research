# Terastation-III-research

Tools for installing modern Debian on Terastation III (TS-WXL, TS-XL, TS-RXL) devices.

Everything here is experimental and will likely change greatly as we move forward. 

The kernel/installer images have been tested on the TS-WXL and TS-XL, and TS-RXL.

details for setting up a boot partition can be found at (or the stock firmware's partitions a can be re-used):

more detailed instructions will be posted when things progress a bit farther.
