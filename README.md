# Terastation-III-research

Tools for installing modern Debian on Terastation III (TS-WXL, TS-XL, TS-RXL) devices.

Terastation III support is now part of the armel installer of the main project:

I may still use this project for hosting experimental kernels/patches not ready for the main project from time to time.
